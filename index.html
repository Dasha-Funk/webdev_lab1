  <p>&amp; Hello world. This is my first website!</p>
  <p>Hello, I am Dasha. I am 35 years old, a stay at home mom and a wife.</p>
  <p>I found coding about 4 years ago and was very excited to learn more about it. I got sucked into youtube tutorials and ended up burning myself out.</p>
  <p>This time around I would like to focus more on the fun of it, rather than the career/money aspect of it. The prospect of having this skill in my pocket is very exciting to me.</p>
